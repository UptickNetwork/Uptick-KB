##  **1. Overview**

With the continuous development and improvement of Web3 technologies, including blockchain, traditional Web2 applications are transitioning to Web3. NFT technology, as a significant carrier of digital assets in the Web3 domain, has become a major focus of attention. The industry expects breakthroughs and implementation of commercial applications, which are believed to be one of the triggers for the next market cycle. We firmly believe in this thesis and are committed to integrating various digital asset application scenarios and token economy models, represented by NFTs, into the public chain system effectively.

 Our aim is to create a sustainable ecosystem in Web3, allowing utility tokens to effectively play their role in promoting the development of virtual and real-world economies, while avoiding mere financial speculation, and instead, encouraging long-term thinking.

The previous focus of NFT applications at the creative, and underlying blockchain and L2 level, has resulted in a lack of sustainable development capacity for numerous NFT applications. The lack of an infrastructure platform that can provide true commercial-level support for NFTs is the key issue. As a result, NFT progress in the commercial field has been slow, and enterprise-level applications transitioning from Web2 to Web3 have stalled.

The most common issues include unstable operation of commercial applications, contradictions between efficiency and security, high development and operation costs, lack of guaranteed cross-domain asset rights and atomicity, and a severe shortage of commercial middleware modules.

Uptick Network's core technical team has experienced the full cycle from Web1 to Web3, and has rich experience in research, development, and operation of commercial-grade infrastructure and applications. We are building Uptick Network to provide technical support, one-stop solutions, and an ecosystem development platform for NFT-related commercial applications. The aim is to construct a Web3 ecosystem application system based on commercial-grade NFT infrastructure and services.

**Philosophy**

We strongly believe that any asset, whether native to the crypto world or mapped from the physical world, needs unique issuance and ownership rights confirmation. NFTs are the technical carriers of all digital assets. Digital assets based on NFTs need atomicity and standardization to be freely and losslessly transferred between different blockchain economies, possessing complete traceability and cross-application, and cross-chain interoperability. This ensures the sustainable value of encrypted digital assets as private property.

_This document not only describes the overall architecture and modular composition of Uptick Network but also provides foundational knowledge within certain modules. This approach allows readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the single document._

## **2. System Architecture**

Uptick Network's technical architecture features a multi-layered, modular blockchain infrastructure with each layer having horizontal expansion capabilities and modular encapsulation.

**Four Main Layers**

*  **Base Layer**

*  **Protocol Layer**

*  **Framework Layer**

*  **Ecosystem Application Layer**

In the **base layer**, there is the native Uptick Chain based on the Cosmos-SDK, which by default has IBC cross-chain capability, solving the cross-chain protocol capability between homogeneous chains within Cosmos technology. Additionally, Uptick Network has developed a cross-chain bridge (UCB) between heterogeneous chains, enabling the free transfer and interoperability of NFT assets between homogeneous and heterogeneous chains.

Uptick Network integrates basic components such as oracles, IPFS, and DID, forming a robust underlying infrastructure layer.

Based on these components, the Uptick Protocol is abstracted according to the business model, forming the **protocol layer**. In this layer, metadata standards for various digital assets using NFTs as carriers are encapsulated, as well as decentralized protocols for NFT operations on the local chain and cross-chain, commercial logic, economics, and governance. Additionally, Layer 2 solutions for further expansion are also prepared. The protocol layer is modularly encapsulated, providing open extensibility.

In the **framework layer**, supporting services for commercial NFT assets are provided, and modules such as multi-chain data analytics, omnichannel payment, copyright and royalty management, digital asset wallet management, digital asset transaction management, decentralized data services, and decentralized governance services are built based on standard protocols. This allows developers to quickly and conveniently develop decentralized commercial-grade NFT applications (dApps) through the framework layer and Web3 API.

The **ecosystem application layer** is an open ecosystem application system, including a general NFT trading platform created by the Uptick Network team and various applications based on years of industry experience. More importantly, it will consist of ecosystem applications created by global commercial application developers and operators. We believe that high-quality NFT infrastructure platforms and effective incentive mechanisms will attract a large number of high-quality commercial applications to be implemented on the Uptick Network.

**Uptick Network Infrastructure | Key Components**

## **3. Uptick Chain**

<img src="https://github.com/UptickNetwork/Uptick-KB/blob/main/image/UptickChain.png" style="width: 90%;">

Uptick Chain is an NFT ecosystem application chain built on the Cosmos-SDK that provides comprehensive underlying support for a range of different NFT application scenarios, including cross-chain NFT asset support. It integrates the IBC cross-chain features of the Cosmos Ecosystem and is fully compatible with the mainstream EVM system, allowing Uptick Chain to offer extensive additional underlying support for NFT applications.

### **3.1. Built on Cosmos-SDK**

<img src="https://github.com/UptickNetwork/Uptick-KB/blob/main/image/BuiltonCosmos-SDK.png" style="width: 80%;">

In the Cosmos Ecosystem, developers can use the Cosmos-SDK to build custom blockchain applications, achieving highly customizable, modular, secure, and high-performance decentralized applications.

### Cosmos Ecosystem Featuresï¼š

**Cross-chain Interoperability**

 Cosmos supports the transfer of assets and data between a variety of different blockchains via its Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). This enables Cosmos-based blockchains to interoperate with other IBC-supported chains, and facilitate cross-chain transfers of FTs, NFTs, and other data types.

**Modularity**

 The Cosmos-SDK provides a series of predefined modules with various functions, such as governance, staking, token management, and cross-chain communication. Developers can combine and customize these modules according to their needs to build blockchain applications that meet specific business requirements.

**Scalability**

 The Cosmos Ecosystem adopts layered architecture, achieving high scalability. Different blockchains can operate independently within the Cosmos Ecosystem without interference, reducing congestion issues and improving overall network performance.

**High Security**

 The Cosmos-SDK utilizes the Tendermint consensus algorithm, which is a BFT-based consensus mechanism that ensures the security and stability of blockchain applications. Cosmos-SDK also provides a set of resilient security features, such as role-based access control and multi-signature, which protect user assets and data.

 **Open-source and Community-driven**

 Cosmos is an open-source community-led project and its source code and documentation are available on GitHub. Developers and community members are able to actively participate in the development and maintenance of the project, while also promoting the growth and innovation of the wider Cosmos Ecosystem.


 **Why Uptick Network Chose Cosmos**

Uptick Network chose the Cosmos-SDK to build its Layer 1, creating an NFT-centric ecological application chain, primarily for the following reasons:

* Robust security and stability of the underlying layer in P2P networks and BFT consensus through Tendermint.

* Facilitates the cross-chain transfer of FT/NFT assets within the Cosmos Ecosystem or networks supporting the IBC standard through the Cosmos-provided IBC protocol.

 _The cross-chain transfer here includes:_

* Interchain transfer protocol based on the ICS-20 standard for FTs, with multi-chain FT support within the Cosmos Ecosystem, cross-chain to the Uptick Chain, and the conversion of FT assets into EVM system ERC20 tokens. Through UCB and other basic modules, it can cross-chain to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Polygon EVM ecosystems.

 * Interchain account management protocol based on ICS-27; a cross-chain account management protocol that improves the cross-chain interaction experience, allowing users to maintain a single interface without perceiving cross-chain interactions.

* Interchain transfer protocol based on the ICS-721 standard for NFTs allows cross-chain NFT interoperability between IBC-connected blockchains (including homogenous and heterogeneous chains). Although the IBC-NFT cross-chain is still in its nascent infrastructure-building stage, the commercial scenarios are yet to be explored. Uptick Network will be among the first to build cross-chain NFT infrastructure, and one of the first commercial application public chains.

 * By using the Gov module in Cosmos-SDK and related supporting economic models, DAO functions can be implemented.

**SDK Enhancement**

In addition to using the existing Cosmos-SDK, Uptick Network actively participates in the optimization and iteration of the SDK based on business needs and a deep understanding of the SDK, making its own contributions to the community. Combining the existing SDK, we are considering the following aspects:

 * Optimize the data storage module to reduce the disk space required for chain operation.

* Develop an internal NFT transfer protocol and make it available as an open-source extension SDK for the Cosmos community (for specific NFT internal conversions, please refer to 5.3 Programmable NFT Protocol).

 * Expand the functionality of the SDK so that it can call external ecosystem services internally, such as Chainlink's VRF random number feature.

### **3.2. Major Smart Contract Language Support**

<img src="https://github.com/UptickNetwork/Uptick-KB/blob/main/image/MajorSmartContract.png" style="width: 80%;">

Smart contracts are highly deterministic, tamper-proof, and reliable digital protocols that run on decentralized blockchains. Since NFTs were initially built on the ERC protocol, most mainstream NFT platforms now support smart contracts. However, traditional NFT platforms only support NFT assets on EVM or WASM. Both types of NFT assets have their application scenarios and business requirements for mutual conversion.

 Therefore, Uptick provides support for mainstream EVM and WASM contracts and seamless conversion between the two types of assets at the contract layer.

### Benefits of this Approachï¼š

**Leverage Advantages of Various Contracts**

 EVM-based contracts have more developers, and most NFT assets (over 90%) are based on the ERC protocol. The security of EVM has been verified by numerous applications, so financial-grade NFT transactions typically use EVM-based smart contracts. Conversely, WASM-based contracts have features such as high execution efficiency, memory safety, and platform independence, supporting newer application scenarios (such as the functional and social NFT applications introduced later).

**Mutual Conversion Based on Business Requirements and Scenarios**

 Uptick facilitates the mutual conversion of contracts at the underlying level, implementing contract conversions at the chain level. For example, if an EVM contract or part of the NFT assets within it needs to be converted into WASM contract-type assets, Uptick's underlying contract converter can achieve seamless NFT asset conversion.

It should be noted that the underlying technology of blockchain contracts is constantly being updated. Therefore, we will continuously update Uptick's contract engine to be compatible with the latest contract development languages such as _MOVE_ in the future.

## **4. Base Layer Modules**

<img src="https://github.com/UptickNetwork/Uptick-KB/blob/main/image/BaseLayerModules.png" style="width: 80%;">

Uptick Network has built a complete set of fundamental modules in the upper layer of the Uptick Chain, which have been continuously improved through long-term practice.

**Fundamental Modules**

### **4.1. Oracle**

Oracle is a decentralized network that connects blockchain to real-world data sets, providing essential infrastructure. Uptick Marketplace and other ecosystem applications can use Chainlink VRF to implement gamification scenarios driven by random numbers, such as decentralized lottery functions.

Upon the launch of the Uptick Chain Mainnet, we plan to establish Oracle nodes on the Uptick Chain to better integrate oracle services, which will offer the following features:

**DeFi**

Provide accurate price reference feeds

**Enterprise Applications**

Serve as an abstraction layer for blockchain

 **Network Infrastructure Services**

Operate as a decentralized oracle network

**NFTs and Gaming**

Offer dApp users a verifiably fair and dynamic gaming experience

**Climate Data Market**

Deliver enterprise-grade middleware for a highly integrated, interoperable, and efficient climate market

Through these features, Uptick aims to provide a more seamless and integrated blockchain experience for users, while ensuring the reliability and accuracy of data through the use of decentralized oracle networks.

### **4.2. Uptick Cross-chain Bridge (UCB)**

<img src="https://github.com/UptickNetwork/Uptick-KB/blob/main/image/UptickCross-chainBridge.png" style="width: 90%;">

In Cosmos-SDK, Tendermint light clients use twisted Edwards curves (Ed25519) which are not compatible with the Ethereum chain that operates on BN254. Consequently, on-chain validation of Ed25519 signatures on Ethereum is inefficient and expensive.

To address this issue, Uptick Network has developed the Uptick Cross-chain Bridge (UCB), primarily designed for cross-chain NFT transfers between EVM-based virtual machines.

UCB has already implemented NFT cross-chain functionality for major chains, such as Polygon, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, and will continue to establish asset interoperability with more blockchain systems.

Unlike IBC, which mainly focuses on cross-chain operations within the Cosmos Ecosystem, UCB targets cross-chain asset transfers and tracking for ecosystems outside of Cosmos.

**UCB Three-stage Iterative Evolution Plan**


**UCB V1.0** uses a proxy model similar to the implementation of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). This approach enables fast and relatively low-cost cross-chain transfers through proxies, reducing the likelihood of malicious behaviour, especially when digital assets are used as collateral.

**UCB V2.0** is based on trust in relayers. However, it is overly centralized, with poorer trust assumptions and limited oversight. There is a potential security risk when an attacker controls the majority of bridge fund signatories.

**UCB V3.0** upgrades the existing cross-chain bridge algorithm by implementing cross-chain bridge logic based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). The block header relay network consists of a relay node network that listens for state changes on bridged chains and retrieves block headers from full nodes within the blocks. The relay nodes' primary function is to generate a ZKP that verifies the correctness of a block header from one chain and forwards it to the update contract on another chain. The update contract performs validation and either accepts or rejects proofs from nodes in the relay network.

  A key innovation in this structure is the parallel use of zk-SNARKs, which have succinct verification/proof sizes and do not require a trusted setup. The circuit used for verifying N signatures essentially consists of N copies of the same subcircuit.

<img src="https://github.com/UptickNetwork/Uptick-KB/blob/main/image/UCBThree-stage.png" style="width: 80%;">

### **4.3. Uptick Storage**

Uptick Network's storage module supports IPFS storage, which is a commonly used distributed storage solution in the blockchain and NFT domains. This integration allows for decentralized file storage and access, improving security, persistence, and efficiency in blockchain applications. Uptick Network recommends IPFS as the best solution for this purpose.

To meet ecosystem application storage and performance requirements, the framework layer caches IPFS images into cloud storage services, providing faster access and lower costs. Access to these services is secure and provided via the HTTPS protocol.

Currently, Uptick Network has deployed its own IPFS nodes and is collaborating with industry storage service providers to offer stable, reliable, and secure decentralized storage services for its NFT ecosystem applications.

### **4.4. Uptick DID**

Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a new digital identification system that utilizes blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to provide users with a means to control and manage their digital identities while ensuring security, privacy, and reliability.

In the blockchain ecosystem, DID performs several essential functions, including:

**Decentralization**

 DID does not rely on centralized identity providers, and instead uses blockchain technology to verify the identity, which enhances security and stability through decentralization.

**Control**

 DIDs enable complete control over digital identity without the need to rely on centralized third-party services. Users can create, update, and also delete their digital identity data without the need for intermediaries to facilitate these actions.

 **Privacy Protection**

 DID supports selective disclosure, allowing users to freely choose what personal information to share with others, protecting their privacy. Additionally, DIDs distributed storage method reduces the risk of personal data leaks.

**Cross-platform Interoperability**

 DIDs design follows universal standards, facilitating cross-platform and cross-application interoperability. This means users can use their DID for multiple blockchains and distributed applications without creating separate identities for each application.

 **Verifiable Credentials**

 DID can be combined with verifiable credentials to help users prove their identity, qualifications, or a variety of other attributes. These verifiable credentials can be used in different scenarios to access services, sign contracts, and participate in new ways to vote online, among many other scenarios.

 The role of DID in the blockchain ecosystem is to provide users with a decentralized, secure, and guaranteed controllable digital identity solution which aims to protect their privacy and also enhance interoperability across platforms.

Uptick DID is a decentralized identity credential within the Uptick Network, created based on W3C standards. It addresses the issue of decentralized identity management for users and the ownership problem of NFT assets, especially in cross-chain situations where decentralized identity authentication is necessary to verify the ownership of NFT assets.

### **4.5. Uptick Layer 2**

Uptick Layer 2 is an off-chain scaling solution which is built on top of Uptick Layer 1. The primary purpose is to enhance the performance of Layer 1 blockchains by optimizing transaction speeds, reducing transaction costs, and increasing scalability. By building solutions on Layer 2, it is possible to achieve higher throughput, faster confirmation of transactions, and a much more flexible environment for application development.

### Uptick Layer 2 Benefitsï¼š

**Reduced Fees**

 Layer 2 bundles multiple off-chain transactions into a single Layer 1 transaction, which helps decrease data load. Security and decentralization can also be maintained by settling transactions on the mainnet.

 **Increased Practicality**

 With the combined advantages of higher transactions per second and lower fees, Layer 2 can focus on improving the user experience and expanding the application scope.

As new technologies continue to emerge in the Web3 domain, Uptick Network's core modules will be continuously updated and expanded with new foundational modules.

Uptick Network actively seeks collaboration with technical community teams, in addition to the core team's research and development, to continually enhance and expand Uptick Network's infrastructure.

This ensures that NFTs are able to sufficiently evolve and adapt where necessary over time, and meet the ever-changing needs of users and the broader blockchain ecosystem.

 **Access Control**

 Programmable NFT protocols can provide fine-grained access control mechanisms, defining who can interact with the NFTs and under what conditions. This can include permissions for creating, transferring, or modifying the NFTs. By leveraging a programmable NFT protocol in Uptick Protocol, developers and creators can build more dynamic, flexible, and powerful applications that harness the full potential of NFT technology.

### **5.2. Interchain NFT Protocol**

Cross-chain transfers of NFTs across multiple chains are achieved through various cross-chain protocols or supplementary cross-chain protocols, enabling NFT assets to move from the source chain to the target chain. This process ensures that assets transferred across chains can be mutually recognized within the Uptick Chain.

 The interchain protocol is an industry-specific refinement of the IBC-based ICS-721 protocol, which primarily includes the following components:

**Specifications for Cross-chain NFT Asset Transfers**

 This part of the protocol outlines the rules and processes for securely and efficiently transferring NFT assets between different chains.

**Specifications for Cross-chain Metadata of Various NFT Assets**

 This component focuses on standardizing the metadata associated with various types of NFTs during cross-chain transfers, ensuring that the critical information about the NFTs is preserved and can be properly interpreted on the target chain.

 **Specifications for Mutual Recognition and Traceability of Cross-chain NFT Assets**

 This part of the protocol defines the rules for recognizing and tracing NFT assets that have been transferred across chains. It allows users and systems within the Uptick Chain to identify the provenance, history, and ownership of cross-chain NFTs, enhancing transparency and trust in the NFT ecosystem.

### **5.3. Interchain NFT Protocol**

**NFT Interchain Protocol**

 In addition, Uptick Network supports the EVM module and will also support other virtual machines, such as CosmWasm and Move. As a result, the conversion of NFT assets within the chain is an essential function. The Uptick team provides atomic conversion capabilities for various forms of NFT digital assets.

 This protocol enables the internal conversion of NFT assets, and the internal conversions within the Uptick Chain, including:

**Cosmos Native NFT \<=\> ERC-721 Assets**

 This conversion enables the seamless transition between Cosmos native NFTs and ERC-721 assets, allowing users to utilize and manage their assets across different blockchain ecosystems.

**Cosmos Native NFT \<=\> CW-721 Assets**

 This conversion supports the interchange between Cosmos native NFTs and CW-721 assets, which are NFTs on the CosmWasm platform. This conversion expands the range of NFTs available to users within the Cosmos Ecosystem.

**ERC-721 Assets \<=\> CW-721 Assets**

 This conversion allows for the direct exchange of ERC-721 assets and CW-721 assets, enabling users to move NFTs between the Ethereum Ecosystem and the CosmWasm platform more efficiently. This conversion enhances the interoperability of NFTs across different blockchain platforms.

**5.4. NFT Scenario Protocol**

The infrastructure requirements for the Uptick Network vary depending on different applications. Some use cases require high real-time performance and high concurrency, while others demand higher security levels, high data throughput, and low gas fees.

 To cater to the needs of a diverse range of applications, the Uptick Network classifies NFT assets into the following categories:

 **Collectible**

 These NFTs represent unique digital items or collectibles, such as artwork, trading cards, or virtual in-game items. Collectibles usually focus on uniqueness and scarcity.

**Functional**

 Functional NFTs provide specific functions or utilities within a platform or application, such as membership and loyalty, coupons and vouchers, tickets, access to content, voting rights, or in-game assets that enhance gameplay.

 **Social**

 Social NFTs are related to social interaction and engagement, such as badges or rewards for achievements and participation in online communities, events, or platforms.

 Uptick Network provides infrastructure protocol layer services with different characteristics according to various business scenarios to meet the needs of different applications.

### **5.5. DeFi Protocol**

NFTs are unique digital assets and require Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and other financial infrastructures to enhance liquidity and yield higher returns. To cater to DeFi applications, the Uptick Network has formulated the following guidelines:

**FT Asset Conversion Standard**

 This standard facilitates the pricing and trading operations of NFT assets based on the conversion of FT assets.

**NFT Asset Collateralization Standard**

 Similar to FT assets, NFT assets can also obtain returns through collateralization.

**NFT Asset Leasing**

 In contrast to FT assets, NFT assets possess practical applications and can generate revenue via leasing.

 The current NFT protocols primarily focus on single-chain support, which is inadequate for handling cross-chain scenarios effectively. The ERC and CW protocols, for instance, do not consider cross-chain use cases.

Uptick Network's universal protocol builds upon the foundation of the ERC and CW protocols by incorporating additional infrastructure and application layer requirements, resulting in a comprehensive protocol designed for the application layer.

As Web3 continues to evolve, more universal protocols will be developed, optimized, and improved to meet growing demand.
